date +%s: This command returns the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). The %s option specifies the output format as seconds.

sha256sum: This command computes the SHA-256 hash of the input data. In this case, the input data is the output of the date command.

base64: This command encodes the input data in Base64 format. Base64 encoding is commonly used to represent binary data in an ASCII string format.

head -c 12: This command takes the first 12 characters from the output of the base64 command. It limits the output to 12 characters.

echo: This command adds a newline character after the 12 characters, ensuring that the generated password is displayed on a new line.

password=$(...): This line assigns the output of the entire command sequence to the password variable. The $(...) syntax is used for command substitution, which means the output of the enclosed commands will be assigned to the variable.
